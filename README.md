We created AwesomeSpace | Exoplanet Explorer AR, a mobile app that lets users explore exoplanets by simply scanning the sky with their phones. Using augmented reality (AR), users can see detailed 3D models of exoplanets appearing in their environment. Along with the visual, the app provides key facts like the planet's size, distance from Earth, and other cool details. The project tackles the challenge of making space exploration more exciting and accessible. Right now, learning about exoplanets can feel distant and hard to visualize. Our app changes that by bringing these planets to life through AR, right in front of the user. Why is it important? By making space feel more real and interactive, Exoplanet Explorer AR can help spark curiosity about the universe. Itâ€™s a great tool for students, teachers, or anyone curious about space, making it easier to learn about distant worlds and get excited about astronomy.
